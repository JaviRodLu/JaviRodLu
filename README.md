- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Javier RodrÃ­guez (@JaviRodLu), Computer Engineering student at Universidad de AlcalÃ¡.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding in general, but especially in Web. I'd like to know more about data science, 'cause I think it can be useful and interesting.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, C/C++ and much more, and I'd like to deepen in Python, because it was the language I started coding with.
